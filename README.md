# UCI-Credit-Default-Rate-Predictive-Analytics
A decision tree and other models run on the UCI Default Data - Done in R

Need to add:
A confusion Matrix
An ROC Curve

The tree is not how I want it to be.
Some features stil need to be built and I aim to run a NN (Neural Network on it)

Any reccomendations would be appreciated!
